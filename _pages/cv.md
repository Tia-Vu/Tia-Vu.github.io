Education
======
* PhD in Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2025-?
* M.S. in Computer Science, Cornell University, 2024
* B.S. in Computer Science (Summa Cum Laude), Cornell University, 2022
* Minor in Material Science Engineering and Linguistics

Work Experience
======

## Software Development Engineer Intern
_Amazon AWS Directory Services_\
Summer 2024

* Designed and implemented a centralized GDPR compliance system of AWS Directory Services 
which was scalable to tens of thousands of events per minute
* Ensured that the new system was extensible and usable across multiple teams in Directory Services

## Materials Process and Engineering Intern
_Viasat Inc_\
Summer 2021

* Drafted material test plans for research and development of composite aerospace structures
* Wrote MATLAB scripts for flight testing of mechanical structures

Research
======

## Proofs for Deductive Databases
_Under the guidance of Nate Foster and Ryan Doenges_\
Designing a proof system for extensions of Datalog to provide methods for debugging queries and verifying the correctness of query results.

* Created an elegant proof system for the Egglog language (an extension of Datalog with equality saturation)
* Programmed a verified proof checker in for the proof system in Coq
* Wrote a master’s thesis on the proof system and its applications with case study on optimizing NetKAT programs using Egglog

## Machine Learning with Humans in the Loop
_PI: Chien-Ju Ho_\
Analyzing human behavior to develop artificial intelligence agents designed to cooperate with humans using reinforcement learning.

* Created human models incorporating human cognitive bias and level-k game theoretic frameworks
* Implemented a markov decision process environment and value iteration for evaluation of AI agents
* Evaluated performance of different AI agent models and their cooperation abilities with human models

## SARA: Integrating Materials Theory, Experiment, and Computation
_PI: R.B. van Dover, Michael Thompson_\
Integrating materials science and computer science methods to dramatically accelerate by orders of magnitude, the discovery and development of new materials.

* Used hyperspectral imaging and transfer matrix method to determine the optical depth of various amorphous and crystalline thin films to understand their composition
* Performed photolithography, sputtering deposition, and profilometry 

Projects
======

## Eta Compiler
* Designed and implemented a compiler for the Eta language 
(an imperative programming language designed for CS 5120) in Kotlin which [ranked among the 
top four compilers in the class](https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs4120/2023sp/project/bakeoff/)
* Implemented Copy Propagation, Constant Folding, Dead Code Removal, 
Register Allocation, and Conditional Constant Propagation
