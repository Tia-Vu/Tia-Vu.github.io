A little collection of the hobbies I have acquired over the past few years...or decades

Lion Dancing
======

For the last year, I have studied lion dancing from [Cornell Lion Dance club](https://www.instagram.com/liondance_cornell/) and 
[Mak-Fai Kung Fu and Lion Dance](https://www.makfailiondance.com/).

[ISU's Winter Gala Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8_vOy84bfA), or [CLD's showcase performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlDutedmz_c).


Chinese Yo-Yo
======

More recently, I picked up the Diabolo or Chinese Yo-Yo and have been a part of
[Cornell Pro-Yos](https://www.instagram.com/cuproyos/) and [Apex Diabolo](https://apexdiabolo.com/). My most recent performance
was the [AANHPI Heritage Month Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJhbPJH74M).

Bridge
======

In my last year in undergrad, I picked up a little bit of bridge. I currently play Precision Club, and I'm
on [bridge base](https://www.bridgebase.com/) under the name cs_ling.


Linguistics
======
 
I like to dabble in linguistics, and some of my current topics of interest include syntactic topicalization, tonal languages, 
and the general field of pragmatics and semantics.

In my free time, I also enjoy learning and creating new languages. Languages that I am currently studying or have studied in the past include:

* Vietnamese
* French
* German

And here are some languages I would like to study in the future:

* Japanese
* Swedish
