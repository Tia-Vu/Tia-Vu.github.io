Hi! My name is Tia and I'm a second year M.S. student in CS at Cornell with a concentration in programming
languages and logics. I am currently advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/"> Nate Foster</a> and
<a href="https://ryandoeng.es"> Ryan Doenges</a> on my research in verification and proof system design for
deductive databases. My research interests include type theory and programming language design. 

I previously did my B.S. in Computer Science and minored in Material Science Engineering and Linguistics.
