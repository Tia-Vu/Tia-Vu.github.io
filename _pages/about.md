Hi! My name is Tia and I'm an MIT Computer Science PhD student advised by <a href="http://adam.chlipala.net"> Adam Chlipala</a> concentrating in programming
languages and logics. I was previously an M.S. student at Cornell University advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/"> Nate Foster</a> and
<a href="https://ryandoeng.es"> Ryan Doenges</a> where I worked on verification and proof system design for deductive databases. My research interests include programming language design and verification.

My other academic interests include linguistics (spanning pragmatics, semantics, and phonology) and materials science and engineering.
